Welcome to the Mint Cocoa (or MCC)) project! MCC is a work in progress, but a pre-alpha should be released within 3 months of work. 

The main goal of MCC is to be minimal and make tough coding easy via shortcuts. Things like adding styles, while simple, are tiring and take too much time. MCC is for the developer who likes minimal things and likes prioritizing their time. In MCC, long, common functions will be shortened and simplified to save time and space in your memory. (recalling certain codes is hard, let me tell you)

MCC is a one person project, since I know where I'm going with it and want to keep it that way, but feel free to give me tips. I'm new to this, so don't expect super fast updates.
